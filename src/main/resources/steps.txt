This file is to follow the steps taken to create this project.

1. Create the repository, init with git and push it to remote
2. Create a HelloWorldResource class file which returns hello-world string at hello-world endpoint
3. For the same, add a @Controller (to specify it as a controller which routes the incoming http requests,
    and add a @RequestMapping(<endpoint>) to mention the path mapping
4. Since spring expects a view with the same name, add another annotation - @ResponseBody -> which will create a view
    with the same name to display the response

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Adding @ResponseBody annotation to create a view for each of the controller methods is repetitive. Hence add
    @RestController (which is a combo of @Controller and @ResponseBody)

2. Create a bean HelloWorldBean and return it. Create a new class for the same with constructor, getter, setter, etc..
    and return it. Add a corresponding endpoint to return this bean

    This bean is now being returned as a JSON. This magic is done by Jackson which maps java beans to HTTP/JSON response
    (which is further included by spring-boot-starter-web)

-----------------------------------
Path variable/Path params:

REST URIs contain complex paths, some of them even being values (Ex: /users/Bharath/todos/1 -> Bharath and 1 are values,
users and todos are path names). These are taken care by Path variable (refer /hello-world-path-param endpoint
definition for details)
