This file is to follow the steps taken to create this project.

1. Create the repository, init with git and push it to remote
2. Create a HelloWorldResource class file which returns hello-world string at hello-world endpoint
3. For the same, add a @Controller (to specify it as a controller which routes the incoming http requests,
    and add a @RequestMapping(<endpoint>) to mention the path mapping
4. Since spring expects a view with the same name, add another annotation - @ResponseBody -> which will create a view
    with the same name to display the response
